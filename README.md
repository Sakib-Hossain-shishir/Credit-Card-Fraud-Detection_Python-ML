# 🚨 Fraud Detection ML Application

This project builds a machine learning system to identify fraudulent financial transactions using structured data, feature engineering, and a fully interactive Streamlit application.  
The goal is straightforward: detect suspicious transactions early, reduce risk, and demonstrate a clean, production-ready ML workflow.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze transaction patterns that differentiate fraud from legitimate activity  
- Engineer meaningful features that improve fraud detection accuracy  
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for classification  
- Deploy a real-time prediction interface using Streamlit  
- Provide insights into the most influential fraud indicators

## 🔬 Workflow Breakdown

### **1. Data Cleaning**
- Remove missing and inconsistent values  
- Standardize feature formats  
- Encode categorical transaction types  
- Identify extreme outliers (e.g., impossible balances)

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Transaction type distribution  
- Fraud vs. non-fraud comparison  
- Balance behavior patterns  
- Correlation matrix & feature importance  

### **3. Feature Engineering**
- Net balance change  
- Transaction anomaly ratios  
- Categorical → numerical transformations  
- Scaling numerical values  

### **4. Model Training**
Algorithms explored:
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  
- Gradient Boosting
